	      <p>The Quicken financial data has been restructured for conversion to QuickBooks.<br>
		The SCRRF financial data  is now structured the same as FLL and FTC, with events and funds in Categories and with income and expense classes in Tags. Tags are now the same for all three programs, so I added a new summary report for LARobotics Tags. The financial reports will be regenerated in a new format after conversion to QuickBooks.</p>
