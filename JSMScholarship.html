			“John was a STEM education giant in LAUSD, especially for his students in South LA. John worked tirelessly to provide opportunities for his students in the Hawkins HS community and his prior school community, Manual Arts HS. I have had the honor of working with John for 20 years and there was no one more dedicated to his students and the community.”</p>

		<p style="margin-left:26px">
			“His impact will be felt in LAUSD and in the Robotics/Engineering/CTE world for generations. I grew so much by working with him at Hawkins and through all of the endeavors that he included me in. I will always have a smile on my face when I think of him; while my heart is sad, my spirit is inspired by his legacy.”</p>

		<p>Robert Santos and Anna Santos, John’s brother and sister:</p>
		
		<p style="margin-left:26px">
			"John would not want flowers, gifts or any cards but would want something set up to help his students to continue their education after high school. We are trying to set up a foundation to get a scholarship set-up for students at Hawkins and Manual Arts that may need some financial assistance after they graduate. Just like my brother wanted to assure that all the grant money went his robotic projects, we want to assure that the money goes to the students of the robotic community at Manual Arts and Hawkins."</p>
