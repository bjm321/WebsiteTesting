            Nelson Team Grants
		</h1>
          
         <p> <b>Nelson Team Grants</b> seek to enable Title I and STEM-focused elementary and middle schools (grades 4-8) in the Los Angeles area (especially LAUSD) to start teams to participate in the <a href="VEX.html">VEX IQ Challenge</a> robotics program. Our goal is to inspire students to pursue STEM degrees and careers. We provide schools with the resources needed to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers.</p>
<p class="really-important">
    Note: <b>Nelson Team Grants</b> are closed for the 2021-2022 VEX Robotics season. <br>
    The 2022-2023 VEX Robotics season starts with the announcement of the new game at 
    the <b>2022 VEX Robotics World Championships</b> in Dallas, Texas on May 12, 2022. This
    webpage should be updated for the 2022-2023 VEX Robotics season by May 31, 2022.</p>
<h2>
  Returning Schools</h2>
<p>
  Due to the Coronavirus pandemic, we could not hold a regular season with coach training and leagues in 2020-2021. Many teams could not even hold team meetings. Existing teams were not required to participate in an official event last season in order to maintain their team grants in good standing. However, many options were available for teams that were able to meet, including Online Challenges, Virtual Events, and Remote Events. In Southern California, roughly 10% as many teams participated in 2020-2021 as participated in 2019-2020.</p>
<p>
  Schools that received <b>Nelson&nbsp;Team&nbsp;Grants</b> previously and that pay to register one or more teams for the 2021-2022 season are eligible to apply for the <b>Returning&nbsp;Team&nbsp;Award</b>. This award  offers each school a <b>VEX&nbsp;IQ&nbsp;Challenge Field&nbsp;Upgrade&nbsp;Kit</b> ($100), which is required to expand the VEX&nbsp;IQ&nbsp;Challenge field from 4'x8' to 6'x8'. Schools that already purchased the <b>Field Upgrade Kit</b> can be reimbursed by submitting a copy of their paid invoice with the grant application. The award  also offers an additional <b>VEX&nbsp;IQ&nbsp;Robot&nbsp;Battery</b> ($23) for each registered and paid team. Old Robot Batteries that have not been recharged since the 2019-2020 season are unlikely to take a full charge if they can be recharged at all.</p>
<p>
  Schools that received <b>Nelson&nbsp;Team&nbsp;Grants</b> previously and that register more teams for the 2021-2022 season than they did for any prior season are eligible to apply for the <b>1st&nbsp;Additional&nbsp;Team&nbsp;Award</b>. Schools that register at least two more teams are also eligible to apply for the <b>2nd&nbsp;Additional&nbsp;Team&nbsp;Award</b>. Schools that already paid their team registration fees for additional teams can be reimbursed for one or two additional teams by submitting a copy of their paid invoice with the grant application. The items included in <b>Additional&nbsp;Team&nbsp;Awards</b> are listed in the table below.</p>

    <h2>
      New Schools</h2>
<p>
  Schools that have not previously registered any VEX IQ teams and that are interested in starting one or two new teams for the 2021-2022 season are eligible to apply for the <b>New&nbsp;Team&nbsp;Award</b>. Those that are interested in starting a second new team can also apply for the <b>1st&nbsp;Additional&nbsp;Team&nbsp;Award</b>. Schools that already paid their team registration fees for additional teams can be reimbursed for one or two additional teams by submitting a copy of their paid invoice with the grant application. The items included in these awards are listed in the table below.</p>

</div>	
<p>
  Schools that receive a <b>New&nbsp;Team&nbsp;Award</b> are required to register one VEX IQ Challenge team ($150 registration fee paid by grant the first year) and to register that team for and to attend an official event (typical fee $155) each year. Schools that receive a <b>New&nbsp;Team&nbsp;Award</b> should plan to spend up to $155 the first year for event registration and $480 each subsequent year for team registration ($150), event registration ($155), field and game element kit ($120), and for additional robot parts ($55). The recommended team size is 3-6 students the first year and up to 12 students in subsequent years.</p>
<p>
  Schools that receive <b>Additional&nbsp;Team&nbsp;Awards</b> are required to register one additional VEX IQ Challenge team ($100 registration fee paid by grant the first year) and to register that team for and to attend an official event (typical fee $155) each year. Schools that receive <b>Additional&nbsp;Team&nbsp;Awards</b> should plan to spend up to $155 the first year for event registration and $310 each subsequent year for team registration ($100), event registration ($155), and for additional robot parts ($55).</p>
<p>
  Schools should have at least one background-checked adult coach (usually a teacher) for each team attending an event.</p>


<h2>
  2021-2022 LAUSD VEX IQ Leagues</h2>                    
<p>
  Our goal is to start 1-2 new LAUSD leagues and maintain the 10 continuing LAUSD leagues. Some continuing league host sites may change.</p>
<p>
  Each new league should have 16-24 teams. Each continuing league should have 20-36 teams. Each league needs at least 16 teams to qualify top teams for State Championships.</p>
<p>All new schools are expected to send one or more coaches to attend Coach Basic Training.</p>
<p>Coaches that attended Coach Basic Training may attend Coach Advanced Training.</p>
<p>All schools participating in a league are expected to send one or more coaches to attend the League Orientation, if offered.</p>
<p>Leagues will meet after school at least four times between October and January:</p>
<ul>
  <li>September: <b>League Orientations</b> for coaches.</li>
  <li>October: <b>Qualifying Session 1</b>: Practice Teamwork Matches and Qualification Teamwork Matches.</li>
  <li>November and December: <b>Qualifying Sessions 2-3</b>: Qualification Teamwork Matches.</li>
  <li>January: <b>Championship Session</b>: Skills Matches and Judging followed by Finals Matches and Awards.</li>
  <li>All league sessions start at 4:00 PM.</li>
  <li><b>League Orientations</b> end at 6:00 PM.</li>
  <li><b>Qualifying Sessions</b> end at 7:00 PM.</li>
  <li><b>Championship Sessions</b> end at 7:45 PM.</li></ul>

  <li>The robotics equipment will be used for official VEX IQ Challenge events or activities each season.</li>
  <li>My team will complete and pay team registration each season (paid by the grant the first year).</li>
  <li>My team will register for and will attend at least one official event each season.</li>
  <li>My team will participate in post-season surveys to assure that the above conditions have been fulfilled.</li></ul>
<p>
